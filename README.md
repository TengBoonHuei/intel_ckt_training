## Day 3
## Theory - CMOS Fabrication Process In DSM & UDSM Technology
<details><summary> Isolation Process </summary>
  
  #### LOCOS vs STI Isolation Technique
  
  1. Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) Isolation:
      * Traditional isolation technique used in submicron process.
      * Limitation: bird's beak effect causing lost in surface area.
      * Advantage: simple process flow, high oxide quality

  2. Sallow Trench Isolation (STI):
      * Preffered isolation technique for deep-submicron process.
      * Advantage: avoids Bird's beak shape characteristic and allows forming a smaller isolation region.
      * Disadvantage: more complicated technique and large number of process steps.

  Step 3 - Treshold Shift and Anti-Punch through Implants
  * P threshold implant is used to make the NMOS harder to invert and the PMOS easier resulting in threshold voltages balance around zero volts.
  * An implant can be applied to create a higher-doped region beneath the channels to prevent the punch-through from the drain depletion region extending to source depletion region.

  Step 4 - Thin Oxide and Polysilicon Gate
  * A thin oxide is deposited followed by polysilicon. These layers are removed where they are not wanted.

## Day 4
## Theory - Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) Structure
<details><summary> Ideal MOS Structure </summary>
  
  #### Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS)
  * MOS is simply a capacitor built up by a dielectric layer which sandwiched between the metal and the semiconductor layers.
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/212722507-90274be6-b040-4b30-b055-a5751f8bd84b.png)
  
  * MOS do not have current-voltage relationship, but only with capacitance-voltage relationship.
  * At V(gate) > V(threshold), the capacitance is inverse proportional to frequency.
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/212722648-e4ecf3c4-96f5-4f62-bd63-9ec7d23b2fcf.png)
  
  #### Ideal MOS Junction / Capacitor
  * Ideal characteristics
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/212722726-53937105-0b60-4ea5-a0b7-77534974ce33.png)

  #### Three deference MOS operation modes
  1. Acumulation Mode, V < 0
  * When negative voltage applied at the Gate terminal, causing the accumulation of majority carrier (holes) at the interface.
  * Charge at the surface is directly proportional to the negative voltage.
                             
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/212722239-0ed35f62-d7f3-482a-912e-8fee7857def9.png)
                       
  2. Depletion Mode, 0 < V < Vt
  * Semiconductor surface form a depletion region, the surface charge is negative and gradually increase with inrease of voltage.
  * The voltage at which the surface carrier concentration is exactly equal to bulk carrier conentration is called weak inversion/treshold voltage.
  * This is the inversion point where the depletion mode ends and strong inversion started.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/212726227-4817718c-21da-4a22-8453-6a0dcf92bca1.png)

  3. Strong Inversion Mode, V >= Vt
  * At threshold voltage, a channel form at the surface of the semiconductor due to inversion charge.
  * Before threshold voltage, the charge comes from negatively charged ionized acceptor.
  * After threshold voltage, more charge comes from the electrons rather than depleting the holes.

</details>

<details><summary> Non-Ideal MOS Structure </summary>
  
  #### Non-Ideal MOS Structure Effects
  1. Effect of fixed charge, Qf
  * Fixed charge is the charge has no movement and will not vary with voltage.
  * Applying negative voltage at the gate, the surface charge at the silicon will be zero (flat-band condition).
  
  2. Effect of metal-semiconductor work function different, ɸms
  * Both metal and semicondutor are made with different type of materials, hence they have different work function.
  * Work function means the minimum energy required to remove an eletron from a solid material surface into a point in the vacuum.
  * To remove the electrons from the P-substrate semicondutor surface, we have to provide a negative voltage to the gate.

</details>
  
<details><summary> Channel Length Modulation (Punch-Through Effect) </summary>
  
  #### Channel Length Modulation and Punch-Through Effect

  * In real MOSFET, when Vds keep increasing, the depletion region at drain terminal will extended towards the source terminal.
  * This causing the channel length decreases, and Id increase with Vds increases.
  * An extreme case of channel length modulation is called punch-through where the channel length reduce to zero.
  * Punch-through causing rapidly increase in current, Id with inreasing in drain-source voltage, Vds.
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/213145906-2b773870-acf5-4e9a-be11-c9f0ba8a4733.png)

  * The chart below represent the characteristics of the channel length modulation.
  * When the Vds is higher than Vgs - Vt, the drain current (Id) no longer saturated. And the current is inreasing with the Vds instead.

<details><summary> CMOS Inverter - Static Characteristics </summary>
  
  #### Properties CMOS Inverter from Switched Level view

</details>
  
<details><summary> CMOS Inverter - Dynamic Behavior </summary>
  
  #### CMOS Inverter Dynamic Behavior
  * High performance CMOS circuit should have less propagation delay, less rise and fall time.
  * Propagation delay of the CMOS inverter is determined by the time it takes to charge and discharge the load capacitance Cload through the P/N MOS transistors respectively.
  * If Cload increases:
    * Propagation delay (PD) increases
    * Output rise time (Trise) increases
    * Output fall time (Tfall) increases
  * Keeping load capacitance as low as possible can achieve a high performance CMOS circuits.
  
  
  #### Major Components of Load Capacitance

  * Wiring Capacitance
    * Cw : Interconnect wiring capacitance
  
  * Fanout Capacitance
    * Cgsp, Cgsn : source-bulk reverse bias junction capacitance
  
  * Cload = Cint + Cwiring + Cfanout

  3. Increase Vdd
  
</details>

<details><summary> CMOS Inverter - Power Consumption </summary>
  
  #### Dynamic power dissipation due to charge/discharging of capacitance
  * Each time load capacitance get charged through PMOS, its voltage rise from 0 to VDD.
  * Due to this, certain amount of energy is drawn from the power supply.
  * Part of this energy dissipated on the PMOS device while the remainder stored in the load capacitor.
  * During the high-to-low transition, this capacitor is disharged, and the stored energy is dissipated in the NMOS device.
  * The values of the Energy Evdd taken from the supply during the transition is:
     ###### Evdd = Cload * VDD * VDD
  * Energy stored on the capacitor at the end of the transition:
     ###### Ec = (Cload * VDD * VDD) / 2
  * Only half of the energy supplied by the power source is stored on Cload. The other half has been dissipated in the PMOS transistor.
  * If the gate is switched on and off F(0-1) times per second, the power consumption equals:
     ###### Pdyn = Cload * VDD * VDD * F(0-1)
  
  
  #### Dissipation due to Direct Path Current
  * Energy consume per switching period:
     ###### Edp = VDD * Ipeak * Tsc
  * The average power consumption:
     ###### Pdp = Csc * VDD * VDD * F
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/216771484-f002010a-37ef-45dd-9168-261337331d61.png)

  
  #### Static Power Consumption
  * The static or steady state power dissipation of a circuit is expressed as:
     ###### Pstat = Istat * VDD
  * Ideally, Istat = 0 as the PMOS and NMOS device are never on simultaneously in the steady state operation.
  * But a leakage current flowing through the reverse biased diode junctions of the transistors located between source and drain and the substrate.
  * In general the leakage currents are very small and can be ignored. However the junction currents are caused by thermally generated carriers.
  * Sub-threshold Current: Drain-to-source current even when Vgs is smaller than the threshold voltage.

  #### MOSFET Scaling
  * As transistors get smaller, their power density stays constants, so that the power use stays in proportion with area; both voltage and current scale down with length.
  * Reduction of the size (dimension of the MOSFET) commonly reffered to as scaling.
  * There are two basic types of size-reduction strategies:
    * Full Scaling (Constatnt-field scaling)
      - This scaling option attampts to preserve the magnitude of internal electric fields in the MOSFET, while the dimensions are scaled down by a factor of S.
      - The charge densities must be increased by a factor of S in order to maintain the feild conditions.

    * Constant Voltage Scaling
      - In constant-voltage scaling, all dimensions of the MOSFET are reduced by a factor of S, as in full scaling. The power supply voltage and the terminal voltages remain unchanged.
      - The doping desities must be increased by a factor of S*S (squared) in order to preserve the charge-field relations.

  #### Summary of MOSFET Scaling
  * Constant Voltage Scaling may be preffered over Full Scaling in many practical cases because of the external voltage-level constrains.
  * It must be regcognized, however, that constant-voltage scaling increases the drain current density and the power density by a factor of S*S*S (cubed).
  * This large increase in current and power densities may eventually cause serious reliability problems for the scaled transistor, such as electromigration, hot-carrier degradation, oxide breakdown, and electrical over-stress.

<details><summary> Short Channel Effects </summary>
  
  #### Short Channel Effect
  * A MOSFET device is considered to be short when the channel length is the same order of magnitude as the depletion-layer widths (𝑥𝑑𝐷 ,
𝑥𝑑𝑆) of the source and drain junction.
  * Alternatively, a MOSFET can be defined as a short-channel device if the effective channel length 𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓 is approximately equal to the source and drain junction depth 𝑥𝑗.
  * As the channel length L is reduced to increase both the operation speed and the number of components per chip, the so-called short-channel effect arise.
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/217550870-9ecd5600-70e7-4c42-b59b-bb0b6a2621c4.png)

  * The short channel effects are attributed to 2 physical phenomena:
    * the limitation imposed on electron drift characteristics in the channel
    * the modification of the threshold voltage due to the shortening channel length
  
  * In particular seven different short channel effects can be distinguished
    * drain-induced barrier lowering and punch through
    * mobility degradation or surface scattering
    * velocity saturation
    * impact ionization
    * hot electrons
    * sub-threshold conduction
    * Vt roll-off
  
  #### Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)
  * In small-geometry MOSFETs, the potential barrier is controlled by both the gate-to-source voltage Vgs and the drain-to-source voltage Vds.
  * If the drain voltage is increased, the potential barrier in the channel decreases, leading to drain-incuded barrier lowering.
  * The reduction of the potential barrier eventually allows electrons flow between the source and drain, even if the gate-to-source voltage is lower than the threshold voltage.
  * The channel current that flows under this condition, Vgs < Vt0 is called the sub-threshold current.
                                                                   
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/217555288-78db669a-b40e-4286-85fa-0c60160b292d.png)

  #### Mobility Degradation
  * As channel length becomes smaller due to the lateral extension of the depletion layer into the channel region, the longitudinal electric feild component 𝐸𝑦 increases, and the surface mobility µ becomes field-dependent.
  * Since the carrier tranport in a MOSFET is confined within the narrow inversion layer, and the surface scattering (that is the collisions suffered by the electrons that are accelerated toward the interfaced by 𝐸𝑥) causes reduction of the mobility.
  * The electrons move with great difficulty parallel to the interface, so that the average surface mobility, even for small values of 𝐸𝑦, is about half as much as that of the bulk mobility.
                                                                  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/217560206-e083282a-8801-41b8-a050-0d22bbe9ecc6.png)

  #### Velocity Saturation
  * At low 𝐸𝑦, the electron drift velocity 𝑣𝑑𝑒 in the channel varies linearly with the electric field intensity. However, as 𝐸𝑦 increases above 10^4 V/cm, the drift velocity tends to increase more slowly and approaches a saturation value of 𝑣𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑎𝑡 = 10^7 cm/s around 𝐸𝑦 = 10^5 V/cm at 300K.
  * The performance of the short-channel devices is also affected by the velocity saturation, which reduces the tranconductance in the saturation mode.
  * The drain current is limited by velocity saturation instead of pinch off. This occurs in short channel devices when the dimensions are scale without lowering the bias voltage.
  * The critical voltage 𝑉𝑐 is the drain-to-source voltage at which the critical electric field is reached 𝑉𝑐 = 𝐸𝑐 . 𝐿.
                                                                  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/217563482-0ded5bae-3ab3-4d0d-bdf6-cfd7b69352a0.png)

  #### Impact Ionization
  * Electron-hole pair generated due to high longitudinal electric field by impact ionization.
  * Holes swept into bulk
  * Potential drop by hole current create a bulk-to-source forward bias
  * Additional electron injection and carrier flow into drain.

  #### Hot Carrier
  * Another problem related to high electric fields is caused by so-called hot electrons.
  * This high energy can accumulate with time and degrade the device performance by increasing Vt and affect adversely.

  #### Sub-threshold Conduction
  * When the gate voltage is high, the transistor is strongly ON. When the gate voltage falls below Vt, the exponential decline in current appears as a straight line on the logarithmic scale.
  * This regime of Vgs < Vt is called weak inversion.
  * The sub-threshold leakage current increases significantly with Vds because of drain-induced barrier lowering.
  * There is a lower limit on Ids set by drain junction leakage that is exacerbated by the negative gate voltage.

<details><summary> Process, Voltage and Temperature (PVT) Variations </summary>
  
  #### Process Variation
  1. Variation in the process parameters:
  
    * Impurity concentration densities
    * Oxide thicknesses
    * Diffusion depth
  
  * These are caused by non-uniform conditinos during the deposition and/or the diffusion of the impurities.
  * This introduces the variation of the sheet resistances and threshold voltages of transistor.
  
  2. Variation in the dimensions:
  
    * Width and length variation of MOS Transistors, resistors and capacitors
    * Mismatches of emitter area in Bipolar devices.
  
  * These are caused by limited resolution of photolithographic process.
  * This changes this device performance in the circuit.

  * 5 process corners
    * TT : NMOS and PMOS Typical
    * SS : NMOS and PMOS Slow
    * FF : NMOS and PMOS Fast
    * SF : NMOS Slow & PMOS Fast
    * FS : NMOS Fast & PMOS Slow

  #### Voltage Variation
  * There are multiple reasons for voltage variation
    * IR drop caused by the current flow over the power grid network.
    * Supply noise caused by parasitic inductance in combination with resistance and capacitance. When the current is flowing through parasitic inductance,L it will cause the voltage bounce.
  
  #### Temperature Variation
  * Two fundamental parameters, carrier mobility µ and threshold voltage Vt varies with temperature.
  * Carrier mobility decrease with temperature 
      
      µ(𝑇) = µ(𝑇𝑟)(𝑇-𝑇𝑟)−𝑘µ
  
    Where T is the absolute temperature, 𝑇𝑟 is the room temperature and 𝑘µ is the fitting parameter with a typical value of 1.5
  
  * The magnitude of threshold voltage decreases nearly with the temperature and may be approximated by
  
      𝑉t(𝑇) = 𝑉t(𝑇𝑟) − 𝑘𝑣𝑡 (𝑇 − 𝑇𝑟)
  
      Where, 𝑘𝑣𝑡 is typically about 1-2 mV/K
  
  * 𝐼𝑜𝑛 at high Vdd decreases with temperature, sub-threshold leakage increases exponentially with temperature, BTBT increases slowly with temperature and gate leakage is almost independent with temperature.

<details><summary> Complementary Logic Circuits </summary>
  
  #### Structure of Complementary Logic Circuit
  * Combination of two networks called pull-up network, PUN and pull-down network, PDN.
  * PUN provides connection between the output and the VDD when the output of the logic gate is meant to be HIGH.
  * PDN provides connection between the output and the GND when the output of the logic gate is meant to be LOW.
  * PUN is constructed using PMOS devices, and PDN is constructed using NMOS devices.

  #### 2-Inputs NAND Gate
  * 2x pull-up parallel PMOS transistors and 2x pull-down series NMOS transistors
  * As PDN NMOS are connected in series, when output changed from 1->0, the high-to-low transition time, Tphl = 0.69 * 2Rn * Cload.
  * For PUN PMOS ccoeencted in parallel, there are two cases:
    * Both input = 0: Tplh = 0.69 * 1/2Rp * Cload
    * Either one input = 0: Tplh = 0.69 * Rp * Cload
  * To balance the charge/discharge time of both PUN and PDN, we need to increase the NMOS size to reduce the resistance and discharge time when output transition from high-to-low.

    * Both input = 1: Tphl = 0.69 * 1/2Rn * Cload
    * Either one input = 1: Tphl = 0.69 * Rn * Cload
  * To balance the charge/discharge time of both PUN and PDN, we need to increase the PMOS size to reduce the resistance and charge time when output transition from low-to-high.

## Day 10
## Theory - Sequential Digital Logic Circuits
<details><summary> Structure of Sequential Logic Circuit </summary>
  
  * The output of the circuit depends upon the current values of the inputs as well as previous input values.
  * Sequential circuit remembers some of the past history of the system, it has memory.
  * Critical components of sequential systems are the basic regenerative circuits, which can be classiied into three main groups:
    * Bistable circuits
    * Monostable circuits
    * Astable circuits
  * The bistable circuits are widely used: all the latches, flip-flops, registers and memory elements are made through bistable circuits.
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/220928579-1d0a40ed-9a1b-44ce-9fa1-6f429a7a4afa.png)

  * Bistable circuit has three operating points:
    * 2 stable points
    * 1 unstable point
  * If the circuit is initially operating at one of these two stable points, it will preserve this state unless it is forced externally to change its operating points.
  * Gain at two stable points are less than 1.
  * Gaib at unstable point is larger than 1 in both the inverters. That means, a small perturbation at the input of any o the inverters will be ampliied, causing the operating point to move to one of the stable operating points.

<details><summary> JK Latch & JK Flip Flop </summary>
  
  #### JK Latch
  
  * If both inputs are equal to logic 1 during the ative phase of clock pulse, the output of the circuit will oscillate (toggle) continuously until either the clock becomes inactive (goes to zero), or one  of the input signals goes to zero.
  * To prevent this undesirable timing problem, the clock pulse width must be made smaller than the input-to-output propagation delay of JK Latch circuit.

  #### Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop
  
  * Most of the timing limitiations encountered in the JK Latch can be prevented by using two latch stages in cascaded configutation.
  * The input latch, called Master is activated when the clock pulse is high.
  * The output latch, called Slave is activated when the clock pulse is low.

  #### Basics of Critical Voltage for Noise Margin
  
  * In a system, there are interconnections between device-to-device and will interfered by the noises due to existing of parasitic capacitances.
  * For that, we need to understand the noise margin of the device that can sustain the input noise and make a proper transition to the output.

  * As the I/O pin's physical dimension is huge compared to the core circuitry, the pin parasitic or pin capacitance is huge (10s of pF)
  * To drive such a huge capacitive load, a huge output current is required, which leads the output inverter size to be huge.
  * The huge inverter size also creates the loading effect on the previous stage, which degrades the signal or increases delay and not able to perorm in high frequencies.
  * Hence, we need to design a buffer chain to reduce the loading effect of every stage from core to output pin.

  #### Buffer Chain Design
  
  * In this analysis, we assume a symmetrical inverter where PMOS and NMOS are sized such a way that the rise and fall delay are indentical.
  * Cload = Cint + Cext
  * Cint represents the self-loading or intrinsi capacitane, where Cext represents the external load capacitance attributable to fanout and wiring capacitance.
  * Assuming that the Req stands for equivalent on resistance of the gate, we can express the propagation delay as
  
    * tp = 0.69 * Req (Cint + Cext) = 0.69 * Req * Cint (1 + Cext / Cint)
  
    * tp = tp0 (1 + ext / Cint), where tp0 is called intrisic or unloaded delay.
  
  #### Transistor Sizing Impact the Performance
  
  * By changing the transistor size, the relationship between the Cint and Req to the sizing factor, S is:
  
    * Cint = S * Ciref
  
    * Req = Req / S
  
  * Hence, tp = 0.69 (Req / S) * S * Ciref (1 + Cext / S * Ciref) = tp0 (1 + Cext / S * Ciref)
  * In conclusion, the performance will increases with the increasing of sizing factor S.

  #### Sizing a Chain of Inverter
  
  * 𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑡 = γ𝐶𝑖𝑛, where γ is proportionality constant
  * 𝑡𝑝 = 𝑡𝑝0 (1 + 𝐶𝑒𝑥𝑡 / γ𝐶𝑖𝑛) = 𝑡𝑝0 (1 + 𝑓 / γ), where 𝑓 is efective fanout.
  
  * The goal is to minimize the delay through the inverter chain.
  
  * Delay expression for jth inverter stage:
    * 𝑡𝑝𝑗 = 𝑡𝑝0 (1 + 𝐶𝑖𝑛,𝑗+1 / γ𝐶𝑖𝑛,𝑗) = 𝑡𝑝0 (1 + 𝑓𝑗 / γ)
  
  * Total delay of the chain:
    * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/221412284-fe518a60-634b-457b-be81-e7b93163f8a9.png)

  * The optimum size of each inverter is the geometric mean of its neighbors size:
    * 𝐶𝑖𝑛,𝑗 = sqrt(𝐶𝑖𝑛,𝑗−1 * 𝐶𝑖𝑛,𝑗+1)
  
  * This eans that each inverter is sized up by the same factor 𝑓 with respect to the preceding gate, has the same effective fanout (𝑓𝑖 = 𝑓), hancce the same delay.
  
  * With Cin1 and Cload given, we can derive the sizing factor:
    * 𝑓 = 𝑁^sqrt(𝐶𝐿 / 𝐶𝑖𝑛1) = 𝑁^sqrt(𝐹)
 
  * And the minimum delay through the chain:
    * 𝑡𝑝 = 𝑁𝑡𝑝0 (1 + 𝑁^sqrt(𝐹) / γ), where 𝐹 is overall effective fanout.
  
  #### Choosing the Right Number of Stages
  * The final 𝑡𝑝 expression reveals the trade-offs in choosing the number of stages for a given 𝐹 (𝑓^𝑁)
  
    * 𝑡𝑝 = 𝑁𝑡𝑝0 (1 + 𝑁^sqrt(𝐹) / γ)
  
  * If the number of stages are too high, the first component of the expression, representing the intrinsic delay, becomes dominant.
  * If the number of stages is too small, the efetive fanout o each stage becomes large and the second component is dominant.
  * The optimum number of N can be ound by differentiating the minimum delay expression by the number of stages and setting the result to 0:

## Theory - Folded Cascode Operational Amplifier
<details><summary> Folded Cascode Operational Amplifier </summary>
  
  #### Performance Limitation of Two-Stage Op-Amp
  
  1. Limitation of Two-Stage OpAmp:
  
    * Insufficient gain
    * Limited stable bandwidth - Inability to control higher order poles
    * Poor power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)
  
  2. Motivation behind the Cascode Configuration:
  
    * Additional gain stage (Not attractive due to instability)
    * Increasing of transconductance of 1st and 2nd stage (Bias current increases with transconductance : not power efficient)
    * Increase the output resistance of 1st and 2nd stage (Bias current decreases with Rout : Power efficient)
  
    * Rout can be increased dynamically with cascode structure
      - Cascoding to the 1st stage
      - Cascoding to the 1st stage followed by a 2nd stage
      - Folded Cascode
  
  #### First Stage Cascoding
  
  * Implement the cascoded mirror on top of 1st Differential Amplifier

  #### First Stage Cascoding with a Second Stage
  
  * The increased gain is due to the increased output resistance of the second stage
  * Gain of the second stage increases which enhances the miller compensation
  * The PSSR is the poor because of the miller compensation.

## Day 18
## Theory - Bandgap Voltage Reference (BGR)
<details><summary> Introduction to BGR </summary>

#### Bandgap Voltage Reference (BGR)

* A circuit that produces constant voltage regardless of power supply variation, temperature changes and circuit loading.
* PVT independent voltage reference circuit.
* Output voltage of 1.2V - close to the bandgap energy of silicon at 0 deg Kelvin.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/226161890-dc8f1444-401b-4fba-a2b0-2d457b01f062.png)

#### Why BGR?

* A battery is not suitable for use as a reference voltage source
  * voltage drops over time

* A typical power supply is also not suitable
  * noisy output and residual ripple
  
* A voltage reference IC used buried Zener diode
  * Discrete design required additional components and high requency filtering circuits due to higher thermal noise
  * Low voltage Zener diode is not available.

Solution: A BGR which can be integrated in bulk CMOS, Bi-CMOS or Bipolar technologies without the use of external components.

#### Applications of BGR

* Low Dropout regulators (LDO)

<details><summary> CTAT Voltage Generation Circuit </summary>
  
  #### Circuit Overview
  
  * A cuurent flows through a diode, CTAT voltage will decreases due to temperature increases.

  #### Tuning
  
  * Tune the number of transistors or the amount of current to adjust the slope of CTAT.

<details><summary> PTAT Voltage Generation Circuit </summary>

  #### Circuit Overview and Calculations
  
  * Design another part of circuit to generate a positive slope, PTAT circuit.
  * Using current mirror, Op-Amp or Voltage-control-voltage source

  #### Design using VCVS
  
  * Using Voltage-controled-voltage source integrated into the circuit to measure the current flows through both path.

  #### Design of R1 Resistance
  
  * R1 completely depends upon the power consumption and silicon area budget.
  * R1 = Vt ln(N)/I
  * Resistance decreases, so area decreases with the increase of circuit current.
  * Resistance increase, so area increases with the decrease of circuit current.
  * Also the resistance value depends on number of BJT used in the branch 2. For example, 10uA current with N=8, R1 calculated to be 5.4K Ohm.

<details><summary> Self-bias Current Mirror Circuit </summary>
  
  #### Current Mirror
  
  * The objective of reference voltage generation is to establish a DC voltage or current that is:
  
    * Independent of supply
    * Independent of process
    * Well-defined behaviour with temperature
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/226171413-ec1a615f-c1ab-4b2f-93ac-8938b27d68ab.png)

  * Issue: 
    
    * Output current of this circuit quite sensitive to VDD
    * For less sensitive solution, the circuit must be bieas itself. Example, Iref must be some how derived from Iout.
  
  #### Self-biased Current Mirror
  
  * The idea of self bias is that, if Iout is to be ultimately independent of VDD, then Iref can be a replica of Iout.
  * MP1 and MP2 copy Iout and define Iref.
  * Since each diode connected device feed from a current source, Iout and Iref are relatively independent of VDD.
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/226171649-bfc09e6c-7154-48c0-8c67-37b2dc69c9d3.png)

  * Issue:
  
    * The circuit is governed by one equation: Iout = K * Iref, hence can support any amount of current.
    * To uniquely define the currents, another constrain must be added in the circuit.
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993909/226171726-73096bc2-dfe3-4010-9ab5-5b8a5bc336e3.png)

  * In this circuit Rs defines current uniquely.
  * Both Iout and Iref are very little dependent on VDD.
  * Loop gain always less than one, by default the circuit is stable.
  
  * Issue: 
  
    * An important issue in the supply-independent biasing is the existance of degenerate bias point.
    * Start-up problem when supply turned on.
  
</details>
  
<details><summary> Reference Voltage Branch Circuit </summary>
   
  * Current of I3 is same as I1 and I2
  * Voltage across Q3 is CTAT type
  * Voltage across R2 is PTAT type

  * Design of R2:
  
    * Temperature Coefficient of Vref should be zero
    * As all the values known , α can be calculated easily: R2 = α * R1

</details>

<details><summary> Start-Up Circuit </summary>
  
  #### Start-Up Issue
  
  * The main issue in the supply independent biasing is the existance if degenerate bias points.
  * There are two stable operating points:
    * Iin = Iout = 0A (undesired operating point)
    * desired operating point
  * Must keep the circuit out of the undesired point when the supply is turned on.
  * Must not interfere with the circuit once it reaches the desired operating point.
  
  #### Start-Up Circuit
  
  * Initially circuit current at zero
  * Net2 follows VDD
  * During start-up, VDD is increases, net2 voltage will increase to a certain point to turn on the MP5.
  * Some current will flows into net1 through MP5 causing the net1 voltage increases and turn on the MN1.
  * This will activates the current mirror to copy the current flow in both sides of CTAT and PTAT paths.
  * Until a certain point, the self-bias mirror will reach a stable state.
  * Now the MN3 will be turned off, and the start-up circuit isolates itself apart from the main circuit.
